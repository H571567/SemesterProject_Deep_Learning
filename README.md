Subsea imaging in fishing and shipping

## Introduction
Marine imaging is a valuable tool across many industries,
for example fishing, shipping, and oil production. The
project is meant to introduce you to the many use cases
and specific challenges. 

## Goals
* Explore the current solutions and the possibilities
for computer vision in underwater imaging.
* Gain hands-on experience by creating predictive models using several different data sets
representing some of the fieldâ€™s variation.
