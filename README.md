Subsea imaging in fishing and shipping

### Introduction
Marine imaging is a valuable tool across many industries,
for example fishing, shipping, and oil production. The
project is meant to introduce you to the many use cases
and specific challenges. 

### Goals
* Explore the current solutions and the possibilities
for computer vision in underwater imaging.
* Gain hands-on experience by creating predictive models using several different data sets
representing some of the fieldâ€™s variation.

### My personal goal
In this project I will try the learn the technologies in Deep Learning and create a program which can indentifie fish species, count the amount the fish (and if possible meassure the size of them). To do that I will make seperate notebooks to do the different tasks and in the end make an app which can do all the tasks.
