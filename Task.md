# SemesterProject_Deep_Learning
Subsea imaging in fishing and shipping

### Introduction
Marine imaging is a valuable tool across many industries,
for example fishing, shipping, and oil production. The
project is meant to introduce you to the many use cases
and specific challenges. 

### Goals
* Explore the current solutions and the possibilities
for computer vision in underwater imaging.
* Gain hands-on experience by creating predictive models using several different data sets
representing some of the fieldâ€™s variation.

### My personal goal
In this project I will try the learn the technologies in Deep Learning and create a program which can indentifie fish species, count the amount the fish (and if possible meassure the size of them). To do that I will make seperate notebooks to do the different tasks and in the end make an app which can do all the tasks.

### Method and materials
* DeepFish: https://alzayats.github.io/DeepFish
* https://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/labeled-fishes-in-the-wild/
* https://www.kaggle.com/sripaadsrinivasan/fish-species-image-data

## Blog
Here I will write down the progress I do weeks for weeks starting from week 11.

### Week 11
Checking out dataset from DeepFish and planing what I want to do as listed in "My personal goal".

### Week 12
Mini-project

### Week 13
Trying to use FastAI to train a classification model. Did not work...

### Week 14 and 15
Found a GitHub repo that made method for classification, segmentation, lacalization and counting. For the past 2 weeks I have tried to use this GitHub repo to train a model to that. A describtion of that can be read here: https://github.com/alzayats/DeepFish 
The problem I stumbled on was that I got errors when I tried to use the GitHub repo. I then Tried to import all the methods import all the methods from the repo, but I discovered other errors doing that. In the end of week 15 and beginning of week 16 I decided to abondon this task and restart.

### Week 16
This time I decided to use the dataset from Kaggle.
